          <h3>Manager</h3>
          <p class="small-text big-bio">A Revelle College alumna with a BA in Visual Arts, Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts, Melissa boasts 11 years of professional design and public relations experience. After working for several event planning companies, corporate groups, non-profit organizations, and even personal clients, she eventually founded the AS Graphic Studio. She doesn't have a favorite project and loves them all equally as a mother would her children. Outside of the office, she enjoys crafty projects with her daughter, hosting Pinterest-worthy potlucks, and going to the beach. She's also an avid Diet Pepsi drinker and, despite already having a daughter, is sometimes the unofficial mother of studio staff members. We love her!</p>

          <h3>Graphic Artist</h3>
          <p class="small-text big-bio">An avid dog lover and former track star, Angela is a 4th year Sixth College student studying Human Biology. The words "cute, small, and sass" come to mind when describing this exuberant, young designer. In her spare time, she can be found cuddling with her dog, watching re-runs of the X-Files on Netflix, and searching for the perfect watermelon. Having established a solid background in graphic design during her high school years, Angela has developed an exceptional ability to free-hand recognizably adorable graphics. With her commitment to creativity and her bold determination to color outside the lines, this tiny designer with a larger-than-life imagination is the perfect addition to the ASGS dream team.</p>

          <h3>Mascot</h3>
          <p class="small-text big-bio">A recent addition since ASGS/Triton Outfitters Christmas Potluck of 2015, Pusheen is the vigilant watch-cat of the office. You can find her in her favorite spot perched high above Thao's desk. Don't be fooled by her adorable pink bow though, because she will protect her family (and her donut) tooth and nail!</p>
