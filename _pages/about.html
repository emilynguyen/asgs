    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      At the A.S. Graphic Studio, we love what we do. We work with UC San Diego
      students, staff and faculty to build upon their design concepts and bring
      them to life. From the moment clients call or walk through our sliding
      glass door, excitement within our team fills the air and the creative
      juices start flowing. With our sharpened pencils in hand and pad of paper,
      the collaborative process with our clients begins. A few sketches and
      clicks of our mice later, we present an original product that exceeds
      expectations (well, that is our ultimate goal). Then we wait in
      anticipation for our next design challenge...
