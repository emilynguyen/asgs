    img: shneaky.jpg
    description: <p>This socially conscious MC spent four years at UC San Diego honing his skills in performance and event management while earning degrees in History and the Study of Religion. A ball of raw energy on the microphone, SHNEAKY is a versatile artist who raps over a wide range of music from sample beats to a live rocking band, trap to boom bap, and has begun producing his own tracks based on his eclectic taste of music. His words and his delivery are drenched in emotion whether rapping about being pinned underneath a semi-truck or searching for himself in all the wrong places, his style rings true. In a time when people have access to infinite amounts of music, SHNEAKY reminds us that honest artistry reaches a deeper chord within all of us. His delivery can be likened to a boxer throwing haymakers in a title fight; the poetry leaves you staggering.</p>
